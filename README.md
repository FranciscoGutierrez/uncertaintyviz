# Uncertainty Viz

A (tiny) WebApp to evaluate uncertainty representations.

# Introduction

Information is a big source of uncertainty. Nowadays, data is processed by tailored machine-learning algorithms that are stressed out by on real-time applications. In the pursuit of augmented knowledge, information is overwhelmed to provide deep insight using heuristics and algorithms. Afterwards, it is displayed to the users in form of graphical representations that enhance knowledge. Some factors such as missing data, algorithm accuracy, size constrained representations, generate uncertainty during the process; uncertainty that is not only propagated but also aggregated in each stage. A bad informed uncertainty leads to altered human perception and wrong knowledge. It is essential that visualizations communicate the inherent uncertainty in order to help the users to make well informed decisions.
