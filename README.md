# Uncertainty Viz

A (tiny) WebApp to evaluate uncertainty representations.

# Introduction

Nowadays, data is processed by tailored machine-learning algorithms that are stressed out by on real-time applications. In the pursuit of augmented knowledge, information is overwhelmed to provide deep insight using heuristics and algorithms. Information is presented to users in the form of graphical representations that enhance knowledge. Factors such as data completeness and model accuracy generate uncertainty that is not only propagated but also aggregated in each stage of the process. Uninformed uncertainty leads to an altered human perception and has a huge impact in knowledge. It is essential that visualizations communicate the inherent uncertainty in order to help the users to make well informed decisions.
